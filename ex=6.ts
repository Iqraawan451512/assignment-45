/*6. Stripping Names: 

Store a personâ€™s name, and include some
 whitespace characters at the beginning and end of 
 the name. Make sure you use each character 
 combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name 
 once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. 
 Then print the name after striping the white space*/

 let myName = "\t iqra awan";
 //\t use for space
 console.log(myName);

 let myName1 = "\n iqra awan";
 //\n use for next line
 console.log(myName1);


 let myName3 = " iqra awan ";
 //agr hum inverted coomas ky start or end men space den to bhe 
 //whitespace sy kam kr sakty hen ut uper waly method logical hen
